# Recipe-book-App
Developing a recipe book application that features a variety of recipes obtained through a free recipe API. We need an API key to access this API. Each time the page is refreshed, a new set of recipes with distinct ingredients will be displayed. Additionally, a link is provided to access the recipe website.
